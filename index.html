        <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hello, I am Albina Nyawira Muturi, but my friends call me Nyawira or Hanti. When it comes to talking about myself, I get shy. An overview is that I believe I am creative, smart, playful, and very disciplined. SInce I do not know what to say about myself, I would like to tell you a little about the highlights of my life so far through my background section. If you would like to hang out sometime, there are also a list of interests in which I like to partake. If you like what you are seeing so far, I will also leave some of my contact information so that we can get to interact within and outside Moringa. </p>

        <h2>01_Background</h2>
          <p>I am a graduate. I was a student at Kenyatta University. I studied Analytical Chemistry; and yes, it is as complex as it sounds. I feel like that was a a wasted 4 years, but we step! we keep on moving. I have a little job experience. I did a little interior design after I got acquainted with a autocad and 3DS max application. THat was an interesting time of my life.</p>

        <h2>02_Why Moringa?</h2>
          <p>Interesting story, for the longest time, I had no idea what to do with my life. When I heard about software development, I knew I had to be part of the industry. This is the only industry where I get to be creative, to be full wave nerdy, and to change people's lives using my laptop. After asking around, everyone recommended Moringa School. I am here because I believe that this institution has the capacity to make me a world-class professional. I also get to be a woman in technology and inspire other women to join the tech industry. How cool is that!
      <div class="box3">
        <h2>03_Interests</h2>
          <p>My interests are in anything creative and in anything competitve. I love to play all forms of games except computer games. Growing up with boys did not make video games fun. I have a few board games, I like to go out and play. On that note, can I interest someone in a game of chess? Catan? cards? bowling? anyone?</br>
          With creativity, I just love to put my mind and hands to the test. That is a primary reason why I am at Moringa. I cannot wait to create new things and see how they impact society.</p>
